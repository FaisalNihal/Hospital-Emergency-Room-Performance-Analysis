### âœ… **Recommendations**

1. **Reduce the waiting time** as it directly impact the admission rate %. In 2024, short waiting time (**52.41%**) has almost **4% more** admission rate then long waiting time (**48.9%**)

2. **Develop an extra ER section for old people** as they have highest patient percentage and they are more **time sensitive** (low admission rate and satisfaction score) then other age group

3. **Add more staff for busy periods (morning and night)**, as these periods have **high patient pressure** and waiting time is also high in these period

4. **Try to develop system to collect most of the patient's satisfactory score** as it is really helpful to evaluate operational performance and identify bottlenecks

5. **Provide service in short time for department referral patient**, as short waiting time for department referral patient have high admission rate (**53.2% in 2024**) then non referral, so make sure patient will get service in short time, then provide department referral.

6. **Identify the low satisfied patients and provide special care/service if they visited again**
