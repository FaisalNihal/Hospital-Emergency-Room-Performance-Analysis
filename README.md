# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Performance-Analysis
An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing 19 months of hospital emergency room performance data (Jan 2023–July 2024). Includes insights on wait times, satisfaction scores, admissions, and department referrals to support data-driven healthcare decisions.



🧠 Working Approach:

 Worked with a hospital ER dataset containing 14 columns, including details like patient demographics, admission status, department referrals, wait times, and satisfaction scores.  Built a 4-page interactive Power BI dashboard covering:

1️⃣ Monthly View Dashboard
Visualizes patient trends month-by-month—highlighting total patients, average wait time, satisfaction score, and distribution by gender, race, department, and time of day.


2️⃣ Consolidated View Dashboard
Shows a complete performance snapshot for all 19 months. Key metrics are aggregated to give a clear top-level picture of ER operations.


3️⃣ Customer Detail Page
A searchable table displaying individual patient records including admission status, age, gender, race, satisfaction, and wait time for deeper analysis.


4️⃣ Overall Analysis Page
This page is broken down into Insights, Problems, and Recommendations to derive meaning from the data and suggest actionable improvements.
